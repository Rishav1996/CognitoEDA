Correlation Analysis**\n\n*   **Pearson Correlation (Income vs. Spending)**: 0.010, p-value: 0.889\n*   **Pearson Correlation (Age vs. Spending)**: -0.327, p-value: 0.000\n\n*Interpretation*: There is no statistically significant linear correlation between Annual Income and Spending Score. However, there is a statistically significant, moderate negative correlation between Age and Spending Score, suggesting that older customers tend to have lower spending scores.\n\n### **3. ANOVA for Cluster Differences**\n\n*(Note: Clusters were generated using K-Means with 5 clusters based on Annual Income and Spending Score.)*\n\n**ANOVA for Annual Income across clusters:**\n```\n              sum_sq     df           F        PR(>F)\nC(cluster)  108985.86    4.0  187.797643  1.034690e-65\nResidual     28291.41  195.0         NaN           NaN\n```\n\n**ANOVA for Spending Score across clusters:**\n```\n               sum_sq     df           F        PR(>F)\nC(cluster)  116546.96    4.0  351.652523  5.912224e-88\nResidual     16157.04  195.0         NaN           NaN\n```\n\n*Interpretation*: The extremely low p-values (close to zero) for both ANOVA tests show that there are highly significant differences in the mean Annual Income and mean Spending Score among the five customer clusters.\n\n### **4. Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances**\n\n*   **Levene's Test for Annual Income (Statistic, p-value)**: (statistic=3.73, p-value=0.0059)\n*   **Levene's Test for Spending Score (Statistic, p-value)**: (statistic=7.53, p-value=1.17e-05)\n\n*Interpretation*: The p-values are less than 0.05, indicating that the variances for Annual Income and Spending Score are not equal across all clusters. This violates one of the assumptions of ANOVA, but given the very strong ANOVA results, the conclusion that the clusters have different means remains robust."], 'stage': <WorkflowStage.BUSINESS_INSIGHTS_AGENT: 'business_insights_agent'>, 'prompt': 'ROLE : You function as a seasoned Business Strategist.\nGOAL : Your aim is to derive strategic business revelations from the supplied metadata and quantitative data.\nConcentrate exclusively on strategic business implications.
