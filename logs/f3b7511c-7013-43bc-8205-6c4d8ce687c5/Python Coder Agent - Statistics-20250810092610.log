Here\'s a breakdown of the results:\n\n### Regression Equation\n\nThe model can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n`Spending Score = 73.93 - 0.60 * Age + 0.0079 * Annual Income - 2.01 * [Gender=Male]`\n\n- **[Gender=Male]** is an indicator variable. It\'s equal to 1 if the customer is Male and 0 if the customer is Female.\n\n### Interpretation of Results\n\n1.  **Overall Model Significance:**\n    *   The **F-statistic** is 7.960 with a very low **p-value (Prob (F-statistic))** of `4.91e-05`. This indicates that the overall model is statistically significant, meaning that the variables included (Age, Annual Income, Gender) collectively have a significant effect on predicting the Spending Score.\n    *   The **R-squared** value is 0.109, which means that approximately **10.9%** of the variability in the "Spending Score" is explained by the variables in your model.\n\n2.  **Predictor Variables:**\n    *   **Age**: The coefficient is **-0.6004**. This means that for each one-year increase in age, the spending score is predicted to decrease by about 0.6 points, holding other factors constant. With a p-value (`P>|t|`) of **0.000**, this relationship is **statistically significant**.\n    *   **Gender**: The coefficient for `C(Gender)[T.Male]` is **-2.0132**. This suggests that, on average, males have a spending score that is about 2 points lower than females, after accounting for age and income. However, the p-value is **0.567**, which is much higher than the standard threshold of 0.05. Therefore, this difference is **not statistically significant**.\n    *   **Annual Income**: The coefficient is **0.0079**. This implies a very small, almost negligible, increase in spending score for every $1,000 increase in annual income. With a p-value of **0.905**, this variable is **not statistically significant**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this model, **Age is the only statistically significant predictor** of a customer\'s Spending Score. As a customer\'s age increases, their spending score tends to decrease. Neither gender nor annual income appears to have a statistically significant impact on the spending score in this particular model.'], 'metadata': ['# Dataset Analysis Report\n\n## 1.

Here\'s a breakdown of the results:\n\n### Regression Equation\n\nThe model can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n`Spending Score = 73.93 - 0.60 * Age + 0.0079 * Annual Income - 2.01 * [Gender=Male]`\n\n- **[Gender=Male]** is an indicator variable. It\'s equal to 1 if the customer is Male and 0 if the customer is Female.\n\n### Interpretation of Results\n\n1.  **Overall Model Significance:**\n    *   The **F-statistic** is 7.960 with a very low **p-value (Prob (F-statistic))** of `4.91e-05`. This indicates that the overall model is statistically significant, meaning that the variables included (Age, Annual Income, Gender) collectively have a significant effect on predicting the Spending Score.\n    *   The **R-squared** value is 0.109, which means that approximately **10.9%** of the variability in the "Spending Score" is explained by the variables in your model.\n\n2.  **Predictor Variables:**\n    *   **Age**: The coefficient is **-0.6004**. This means that for each one-year increase in age, the spending score is predicted to decrease by about 0.6 points, holding other factors constant. With a p-value (`P>|t|`) of **0.000**, this relationship is **statistically significant**.\n    *   **Gender**: The coefficient for `C(Gender)[T.Male]` is **-2.0132**. This suggests that, on average, males have a spending score that is about 2 points lower than females, after accounting for age and income. However, the p-value is **0.567**, which is much higher than the standard threshold of 0.05. Therefore, this difference is **not statistically significant**.\n    *   **Annual Income**: The coefficient is **0.0079**. This implies a very small, almost negligible, increase in spending score for every $1,000 increase in annual income. With a p-value of **0.905**, this variable is **not statistically significant**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this model, **Age is the only statistically significant predictor** of a customer\'s Spending Score. As a customer\'s age increases, their spending score tends to decrease. Neither gender nor annual income appears to have a statistically significant impact on the spending score in this particular model.']}]}}
